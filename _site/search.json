    "text": "My Background\nHaving grown up in Zimbabwe, my greatest passion was writing, producing, and performing music. I spent most of my time in my home church and my high school’s music department. I was accepted to Drexel University in 2013 to study psychology, and in my junior year I joined the accelerated BSMS in Psychology program mentored by Fengqing Zhang of the Quantitative Psychology & Statisics Lab. There, I learned about statistical/machine learning, data mining, and computer programming in R & Python, and learned to apply these skills in a range of mental & behavioural health studies. In 2017, I interned at Salesforce as a data scientist in People Analytics, where I worked on NLP and text mining problems geared to improve employee success, and in 2018, I graduated from Drexel with my BSc & MSc in psychology. \nFrom 2018 to 2022, I worked as a neuroimaging data analyst at the Penn Lifespan Informatics and Neuroimaging Center, where I used various softwares and programming tools to process, curate, and analyse neuroimaging data.\nI began my PhD at Northeastern in September 2022."
