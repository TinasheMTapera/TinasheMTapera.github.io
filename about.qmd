I'm a PhD student in computer science at Northeastern University's [Khoury College of Computer Sciences](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/). Specifically, I'm part of the Personal Health Informatics program.

## My Background

Having grown up in Zimbabwe, my greatest passion was writing, producing, and performing music. I spent most of my time in <a href="https://celebrationmin.org/">my home church</a> and [my high school's music department](https://stjohnszim.com/). I was accepted to Drexel University in 2013 to study <strong>psychology</strong>, and in my junior year I joined the accelerated BSMS in Psychology program mentored by <a href="http://www.pages.drexel.edu/~fz53/homepage.html">Fengqing Zhang of the Quantitative Psychology & Statisics Lab.</a> There, I learned about <strong>statistical/machine learning, data mining, and computer programming in R & Python</strong>, and learned to <strong>apply these skills in a range of mental & behavioural health studies.</strong> In 2017, I interned at Salesforce as a data scientist in <a href = "https://www.mckinsey.com/solutions/orgsolutions/overview/people-analytics">People Analytics</a>, where I worked on NLP and text mining problems geared to improve employee success, and in 2018, I graduated from Drexel with my BSc & MSc in psychology. <br>

From 2018 to 2022, I worked as a neuroimaging data analyst at the <a href="https://www.satterthwaitelab.com/">Penn Lifespan Informatics and Neuroimaging Center</a>, where I developed and used various software and programming tools to **process, curate, and analyse neuroimaging data.**

I began my PhD at Northeastern University in September 2022.
