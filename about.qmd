I'm a Master's student in Health Informatics, joint between Northeastern University's [Khoury College of Computer Science](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/) and [Bouv√© College of Health Sciences](https://bouve.northeastern.edu).

## My Background üáøüáº

Having grown up in Zimbabwe, my greatest passion was writing, producing, and performing music. I spent most of my time in <a href="https://celebrationmin.org/">my home church</a> and [my high school's music department](https://stjohnszim.com/). I was accepted to Drexel University in 2013 to study <strong>psychology</strong>, and in my junior year I joined the accelerated BSMS in Psychology program mentored by <a href="http://www.pages.drexel.edu/~fz53/homepage.html">Fengqing Zhang of the Quantitative Psychology & Statisics Lab.</a> There, I learned about <strong>statistical/machine learning, data mining, and computer programming in R & Python</strong>, and learned to <strong>apply these skills in a range of mental & behavioural health studies.</strong> In 2017, I interned at Salesforce as a data scientist in <a href = "https://www.mckinsey.com/solutions/orgsolutions/overview/people-analytics">People Analytics</a>, where I worked on NLP and text mining problems geared to improve employee success, and in 2018, I graduated from Drexel with my BSc & MSc in psychology. <br>

From 2018 to 2022, I worked as a neuroimaging data analyst at the <a href="https://www.satterthwaitelab.com/">Penn Lifespan Informatics and Neuroimaging Center</a>, where I developed and used various software and programming tools to **process, curate, and analyse neuroimaging data.** Primarily, my role as a data analyst involved developing robust, reproducible, and scalable data preprocessing pipelines, using technologies like Python, R, bash, and docker.

## My Data Science Interestsü™ö

My goal as a research software engineer is to advance the goals of PIs, their labs,
and their students, by providing high-quality software and engineering support.
Science is a team sport, and relying on a single data science unicorn is as much a myth as it
is a handicap to good work. As such, my philosophy is that successful labs and teams
silo and integrate different skill sets among talented individuals in the 
data science pipeline. I thrive in roles where I can get my hands dirty tackling 
the nitty-gritty barriers to getting the science done. I love figuring out things
like:

* Documentation: Knowledge is a resource, and everyone should have access to the
"how-to's," in a lab. I pride myself on creating clear, concise, and engaging documentation
of both refined systems, and best practices and tutorials. I use tools such as
automated documentation generators (`roxygen`, `pkgdown`, Sphinx, Quarto, Github Pages).

* Reproducible Data Pipelines: Nothing's worse than looking back over several hours of work
and being unable to figure out how you ended up where you did. I enjoy creating
reproducible and well documented pipelines for data transformation and analysis,
using tools like Quarto, Jupyter, `targets`, `pytask`, `testhat`, `pytest`, `datalad`,
and CI/CD tools like Github Actions.

* Tooling: Your analysis shouldn't be hampered because you can't open an IDE or
install a library; nothing gives me more joy than tinkering with a silly installation
so that it "just works," for everyone who tries it later.

* Accessibility: I don't believe in "gatekeeping" data science ‚Äî it's not true that
only "real programmers" use `vim` to write scripts. It's okay to use tools and
other helpful strategies to make programming more accessible to you, including
friendly IDEs, libraries, and problem-solving paradigms. This is why I'm a huge
advocate of **notebook-driven development** with tools like
[`nbdev` (Python)](https://nbdev.fast.ai/getting_started.html) and
[`fusen` (R)](https://thinkr-open.github.io/fusen/index.html).


## When I'm Not Doing Data Stuff...üè°

-   I'm a mentor in the Data Science Learning Community ([DSLC](https://www.dslc.io/)) slack group (join [here!](https://dslcio.slack.com/ssb/redirect))

-   I'm also a member of the [US Research Software Engineer Association](https://us-rse.org)

-   I [jump rope](https://www.healthline.com/health/fitness/jump-rope-vs-running) as my exercise of choice

-   I play Apex Legends with my wife and my little brother
