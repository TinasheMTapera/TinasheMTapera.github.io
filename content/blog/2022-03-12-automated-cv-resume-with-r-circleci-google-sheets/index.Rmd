<center><b>I hate updating my resume.</b></center>

A couple of years ago I was in a corporate tool limbo as I'd just left Drexel University,
so my license with Microsoft Word had expired. In addition to having the most
difficult time collaborating with MSW users on a paper, I also didn't have a way
to efficiently edit the resumes and CVs I'd developed. I tried opening files in
[Libre Office](https://www.libreoffice.org/), which is a great freeware option
for the office suite of tools, but frankly didn't give seamless transition
between features in MS.

# Why Ditch MS Word for Your CV?

Don't get me wrong -- using MS products is all well and good when that's pretty
much all you do. I once got into an argument with a law graduate friend who made
a very convincing point about how templates are easily transferred, signatures
tracked and authenticated, and multiple versions of documents in print composition
can be compared in their field. But as someone who writes code, I want out of
any scenario where I can't just edit plain text for most of the work.
This is part of a philosophy of the difference between a plain text
editor and a word processor. A word processor workflow does a lot of work for you by
having a point-and-click GUI that formats and automates the styling of a document,
whereas a plain text editor leaves you to only edit the content -- no frills,
no special effects, just content. Then, once you're happy with the _content_ of
your document, you can work on the _typesetting_, or how it will look on a page.

This separation of content creation and typesetting is, in my opinion, a far more
productive workflow that should be adopted by everyone. In fact, if you've ever
written a letter in MS Word, you probably already have adopted this workflow
in the form of _templates_. For a better explanation of why you might want to
separate content creation and typesetting, see [this blog post](https://richardlent.github.io/post/the-plain-text-workflow/).
But there's more to appreciate here when you are
someone who writes code for a living. When you create documents with code
you get all the advantages that come with coding too,
most importantly: version control, continuous integration, and formatting management.

## Version Control with MS Word Sucks

If you've ever created a document and named it `myreport_ProfessorXfeedback_version4_March12_FINAL.docx`,
you already know what I mean.

Using plain text gives you the ability to version
control files with Git+Github and similar tools, which gives you clearer commit
history, change integration, etc. Now, admittedly, MS Word claims to have a
version control system but I've never had much success with that, being totally
honest, especially in comparison to Git-based workflows.

## Formatting

In addition to version control sucking in MS word, managing reference format with
something like `bibtex` also sucks; managing special characters from `latex` is a
huge pain that isn't handled well by MSW either. Again, _plain text_ let's you
see things as you generate them, and worry about what they look like on a page
later. Not to mention... tables ðŸ˜¤

<iframe id="reddit-embed" src="https://www.redditmedia.com/r/mildlyinfuriating/comments/i4r2ox/when_word_refuses_to_align_tables/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share&amp;embed=true" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups" style="border: none;" height="420" width="640" scrolling="no"></iframe>

Once again, you don't have to worry about this formatting nonsense until you're
ready to "publish" your work, and when you are, you have the option to choose
from a variety of formats that your content just gets dumped into. This website,
for example, is build on the [Goa template](https://github.com/kaapiandcode/hugo-goa) from the [Hugo web framework](https://gohugo.io/). I just generate content in any plain text editor,
and drop it into the framework that renders all the fancy bits for me. Speaking
of which...

## Continuous Integration

The best part of this project was making something that could be regenerated any
time I needed it to, by an automated service. As opposed to having to open the
Word document myself, make edits, save it, and export it, I have set up a system
that does all of that for me at the push of a button. The only thing _I_ need to
do to make it work, is to edit the data that goes _into_ the document. I do this with
google sheets, but any data source can be used. This means when I earn a new title,
publication, or role, I just open up google sheets, add a line to the doc with
the details, then hit "Rerun" on the CircleCI continuous intergation service.

That's it; that's really it. No aligning tables, no content formatting, no shoddy
print previews, and the output is accessible from CircleCI any time I need it.

# The Workflow

The downside to this approach should be apparent: **you have to set it up first.**
This entire project took me about 2 or 3 nights on-and-off, but wasn't particularly
challenging. Fortunately, a lot of folks have already accomplished this and it
was easy to follow their instructions, clone their code, and adjust it for my
own usage. Hence, I'm not going to explain how to do it in this post -- just
demonstrate the benefits of doing it. The [Google search results](https://www.google.com/search?q=curriculum+vitae+in+Rmarkdown&sxsrf=APq-WBt8gbmUdcI3cS0kq3tkcSnGuOmEiw%3A1647108030894&ei=vt8sYsySNoyZptQPib6wsAc&ved=0ahUKEwjM6dnIk8H2AhWMjIkEHQkfDHYQ4dUDCA4&uact=5&oq=curriculum+vitae+in+Rmarkdown&gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAMyBggAEBYQHjoHCAAQRxCwAzoHCAAQsAMQQzoECCMQJzoKCC4QxwEQrwEQJzoECAAQQzoFCAAQkQI6BQgAEIAEOg0ILhCxAxDHARCjAhAKOg4ILhCABBCxAxDHARCvAToOCC4QgAQQsQMQxwEQ0QM6BwgAEMkDEEM6CAgAEIAEELEDOgcIABCxAxBDOggIABCxAxCRAjoLCAAQgAQQsQMQgwE6CwguEIAEEMcBEK8BOgoIABCABBCHAhAUOgQIABANOggIABAIEA0QHjoKCAAQCBANEAoQHkoECEEYAEoECEYYAFDTAlieN2CBOWgBcAF4AIABwQGIAf8MkgEEMTYuNJgBAKABAcgBCsABAQ&sclient=gws-wiz)
for this task are full of options, but I especially benefited the most from
[Matt Learyâ€™s resume template](https://github.com/mleary/resume) and
[Sam Abbottâ€™s CV template](https://github.com/seabbs/cv). Ultimately, the
workflow looks like this:

## Input data from Google sheets

This is where it all starts; I found it great to organise it in a [_tidy_ format](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/vignettes/tidy-data.html)
(each data point is a value, each column is a variable, each row is an observation).
Furthermore, I can separate the data into different sheets for different CV categories.

## Read in Data In .Rmd

I wrote a [script](https://github.com/TinasheMTapera/ReproducibleResumeCV/blob/main/run.R) in R that 
sets up and calls the Rmarkdown scripts, with configured parameters for both
the long form CV and the one page resume. 
The RMarkdowns read in the data and parse it into a tidy
format ready for the [`vitae`](https://pkg.mitchelloharawild.com/vitae/) and
[`pagedown`](https://pagedown.rbind.io/) packages -- these do most of the hard
work.

## Knit with `CSS` + `Latex`

The packages for R CVs and resumes come with CSS definition files; I [tinkered](https://github.com/TinasheMTapera/ReproducibleResumeCV/commit/3a19029f0904f81c2cfa070fe6e4d9aec91f96af)
with these minimally, but I'm considering asking a CSS professional to make me a
unique one. Once they're ready to render, `knitr` takes it away, with some help
from `latex`.

## Circle CI

Lastly, I created a [Dockerfile](https://github.com/TinasheMTapera/ReproducibleResumeCV/blob/main/Dockerfile) that runs the above procedure on CircleCI. Once you upload the project
to Github, and link that to Circle, then any time you add a commit to Github,
the procedure runs as a job. You can configure how CircleCI runs in the `config.yml`,
including _storing the output files!_ [These lines](https://github.com/TinasheMTapera/ReproducibleResumeCV/blob/main/.circleci/config.yml#L41-L50) demonstrate how Circle knows to store outputs.

# Running It

Now, whenever I need a new copy of my CV or resume, I just hop on to Google Sheets,
update a new line of info, head over to Circle CI and hit "Re-run workflow".

Like magic, [brand new CV](http://tinashemtapera.com/cv/tinashemtapera_cv.pdf)!
