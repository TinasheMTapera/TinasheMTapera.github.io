Having grown up in Zimbabwe, my greatest passion was writing, producing, and performing music. I spent most of my time in <a href="https://celebrationmin.org/">my home church</a>, where I was frequently exposed to the worship music that ultimately became the backbone of my musical training and experience, some of which I published both in and out of the church arena (and is available <a href="https://soundcloud.com/tinashe-tapera">here</a>.)<br>

I was accepted to Drexel University to study <strong>psychology</strong>, and in my junior year I joined the dual Bachelor's and Master's in Psychology program in order to take advantage of graduate research opportunities with the <a href="http://www.pages.drexel.edu/~fz53/homepage.html">Quantitative Psychology & Statisics Lab.</a> There, I learned and practiced <strong>statistical/machine learning, data mining, and computer programming in R & Python</strong>, and <strong>applied these skills in a range of psychological and behavioural studies.</strong> In 2017, I interned at Salesforce as a data scientist in <strong><a href = "https://www.mckinsey.com/solutions/orgsolutions/overview/people-analytics">People Analytics</a></strong>, where I worked on NLP and text mining problems geared to improve employee success, and in 2018, I graduated from Drexel with my BSc & MSc in psychology. <br>

Today, I work as a data scientist/people analytics consultant at <a href="https://www.teamtrics.com/">Teamtrics</a>, where we're buidling AI to help students have the <strong>Best Team Experience.</strong>. I plan on working in academia a little bit longer, and ultimately hope to continue working on fun data science problems involving people, the brain, or behaviour, in either academia or industry.
